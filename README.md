- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between cells
- **Escape**: Deselect current cell

## üßÆ Algorithm Details

### Sudoku Solving Algorithm
The solver uses a **recursive backtracking algorithm**:

1. **Find Empty Cell**: Locate the next empty cell in the grid
2. **Try Numbers**: Attempt to place numbers 1-9 in the cell
3. **Validate**: Check if the placement violates Sudoku constraints
4. **Recurse**: If valid, recursively solve the rest of the puzzle
5. **Backtrack**: If no valid number works, backtrack and try the next option

### Validation Logic
The validation checks three Sudoku constraints:
- **Row Constraint**: No duplicate numbers in any row
- **Column Constraint**: No duplicate numbers in any column
- **Box Constraint**: No duplicate numbers in any 3√ó3 box

### Time Complexity
- **Worst Case**: O(9^(n¬≤)) where n=9 for a 9√ó9 grid
- **Average Case**: Much better due to constraint pruning
- **Space Complexity**: O(n¬≤) for the recursion stack
